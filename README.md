# The Gender Pay Gap

A regression analysis of the gender pay gap, using the 2017 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), retrieved from https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums.html. None of the data is included in this repository because the raw files are very large, but they can be downloaded following the link above.
